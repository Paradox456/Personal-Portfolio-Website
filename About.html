        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>I'm Annafi Islam, a dedicated and enthusiastic computer science student with a profound interest in technology and its applications. Currently pursuing Computer Science at Queens College, I am on a mission to explore the ever-evolving world of computer science.

            My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, SQL, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I thrive on challenges and enjoy solving complex problems, always seeking innovative and efficient solutions.
            
            During my academic journey, I've discovered a particular interest in Software Engineering, where I aspire to make a meaningful impact. I am also continuously expanding my knowledge through self-directed learning and keeping up with the latest industry trends.
            
            Outside of the academic realm, I am involved in Codepath where I built clones of apps. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skills but also developed my ability to work collaboratively in a team.
            
            I am eagerly looking forward to contributing my skills and knowledge to the field of computer science. Whether it's developing innovative software solutions or diving into cutting-edge technologies, I am passionate about creating a positive impact through technology.
            
            Let's connect and explore the fascinating world of computer science together!
